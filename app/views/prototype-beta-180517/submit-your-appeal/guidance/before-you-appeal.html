      <h1 class="heading-large">2. Before you appeal</h1>
      <p>For most benefits you have to ask the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reconsider their decision before you appeal. This is known as requesting ‘mandatory reconsideration’. DWP will then send you a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN) which tells you whether they have changed their decision. </p>
      <p>If you’re appealing a decision about Housing Benefit then you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council"> contact your local authority</a> before appealing. </p>
      <p>For Child Benefit appeals, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/child-benefit">contact HMRC</a> first.</p> 
      <p>If you can’t find the right contact details, check the last letter you received about the benefit.</p>  
      <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
        <p>You can appeal up to a month after going through ‘mandatory reconsideration’. You might still be able to appeal after a month, but you’ll need to explain why it’s late. </p>
