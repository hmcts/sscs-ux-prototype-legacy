      Sending evidence to support your appeal 
    </h1>
    <p>Evidence includes anything which shows how the claimant’s condition affects their life, such as a letter from their doctor or healthcare professional. </p>
    <p>You or someone who knows them could also write a statement. It all helps the independent tribunal  understand the appeal.  </p> 
    <p>Please send in any evidence as soon as possible after you’ve submitted your appeal. This is so there’s time to read it before the hearing. </p>
    <p>You’ll get an email and a letter telling you the address to post it after you’ve submitted your appeal.
