                <p>DWP have responded to your PIP benefit appeal. They should have sent you a copy of their response in the post.</p> 

<p>A hearing needs to be booked for your appeal. You don’t need to do anything. You’ll be contacted when your hearing has been booked. This may take some time, depending on how busy the hearing venues are.
