                What to expect at your hearing 
            </h1>
 <p class="lede">Your hearing is an opportunity for you to explain your appeal and get an impartial decision on your entitlement to ESA. The tribunal is independent and will listen to both sides before making a decision. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">When you arrive </h2>
            <p>You’ll be greeted by a tribunal clerk. They’ll take care of you at the hearing venue and answer any questions you have. You’ll sit in a waiting area until your hearing begins. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The hearing room </h2>
            <p>The tribunal clerk will take you into the hearing room. The judge and other panel members be sat at a table. You’ll be invited to sit opposite them. If you have someone to support you or to give evidence, they’ll sit next to you.</p>



            <h2 class="heading-medium">The people at your hearing </h2>
            <p>The tribunal is made up of a panel of people who’ll make an impartial decision on your appeal. They are all independent from DWP. </p>

<p>The judge runs the hearing and will explain how it works. They’ll also take notes to create a record of the hearing.</p> 

<p>A doctor will also be there to give medical advice. </p>


            <h2 class="heading-medium">DWP </h2>
            <p>A representative from DWP might be there. They are not on the panel and are there to speak on behalf of DWP. They won’t be the person who made the decision about your entitlement to ESA.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">During your hearing </h2>
            <p>The judge and the other panel members will ask you some straightforward questions. They’re trying to understand how your condition affects your life. It’s your opportunity to explain your side of the appeal. This takes about an hour. </p>

<p>Sometimes the panel will need more evidence to help them make a decision. It’s important that you submit all your evidence well before the hearing so they have time to review it. Otherwise they may have to postpone the hearing to a different day.  
 </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Getting a decision</h2>
            <p>After you’ve answered all the questions you’ll be asked to wait outside while the panel members discuss your appeal. You’ll then be asked back into the room to be told the decision.</p>

<p>The judge will explain whether you’re entitled to ESA and if so, at what level. </p>

<p>Sometimes the tribunal may need more time to make a decision. If that happens the decision about your appeal will be posted to you.</p>
