    <h1 class="heading-large">3. Help with your appeal</h1>
    <p>There’s various help and support you can get for your appeal, from representatives who can advise you to telephone support from the tribunal. </p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Representatives</h2> 
    <p>If you think you’ll be unable to manage your appeal on your own you may want the help of a representative. They can help you with some or all of the following: </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>Advise you on the law in relation to your appeal</li> 
      <li>Help you prepare evidence to support your appeal</li> 
      <li>Help you prepare a written statement for the tribunal</li> 
      <li>Talk to us about your appeal on your behalf  </li>
      <li>Help you explain your appeal at the hearing </li>
      <li>Advise you on what to do after the tribunal has made their decision </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can assign anyone to be your representative, including friends and family.</p>  
    <p>Anyone who is registered as a representative will be sent confidential information about you, such as medical evidence. They can also make decisions on your appeal but should only do this with your permission. </p>
