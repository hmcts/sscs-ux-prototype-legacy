<h1 class="heading-large">Before you appeal</h1>

<p>For most benefits you have to ask DWP to reconsider their decision before you appeal. This is known as requesting mandatory reconsideration. DWP will then send you a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN) which tells you whether they have changed their decision.</p> 

<p>If you’re appealing a decision about Housing Benefit then you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">phone your local authority</a> before appealing. For Child Benefit you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/child-benefit">phone HMRC</a> first.</p> 

<p>You can find their contact details on any letter you’ve received about the benefit. </p>  

<p>You should appeal within a month after going through mandatory reconsideration. You might still be able to appeal after one month but you’ll need to explain why it’s late.</p>
