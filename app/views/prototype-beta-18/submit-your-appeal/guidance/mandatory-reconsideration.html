<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Mandatory reconsideration</h1>

<p>Before appealing most benefit decisions you have to ask the government department who made the decision to reconsider it. This is known as requesting mandatory reconsideration. </p>

<p>To request mandatory reconsideration you’ll need to:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet"> 

  <li>Find out which department made the decision (using the list below)</li>
<li>Find the department’s contact details (from any letters you’ve received from them) </li>
<li>Phone or write to them telling them you want to challenge their decision. </li>
</ul>

<p>Then the department should send you a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN). This tells you whether they have changed their decision about your entitlement to the benefit. If you still don’t agree with the decision on the MRN you can <a href="start-an-appeal">appeal using this service.</a> </p>


<p>You don’t have to get a MRN  for Housing Benefit. You need to <a href="www.gov.uk/find-local-council">phone up your local council</a> and tell them you want to appeal.</p>
