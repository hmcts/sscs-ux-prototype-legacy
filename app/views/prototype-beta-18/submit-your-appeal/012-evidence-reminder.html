            </h1>
<p>Evidence includes anything which shows how your condition affects your life. For example, a doctor’s letter or report. A written statement by yourself or someone who knows you can also help the tribunal understand your appeal. </p>

<p>Please send in any evidence as soon as possible after you’ve submitted your appeal. This is so there’s time to read it before your hearing.</p> 

<p>We’ll send you an address where you can post your evidence. You’ll receive this by [email / post] after you’ve submitted your appeal. </p>
