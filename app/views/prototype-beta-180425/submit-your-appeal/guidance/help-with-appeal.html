    <p>There’s various support available before and during your appeal.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Representatives</h2> 
    <p>If you think you’ll be unable to manage your appeal on your own you may want the help of a representative. They often work for a charity or welfare rights organisation and will provide their services for free. </p>
    <p>A good representative can help you do one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>Advise you on the appeals process </li>
<li>Help you prepare evidence to support your appeal</li>  
<li>Help you prepare a written statement </li>
<li>Act on your behalf during your appeal </li>
<li>Help you explain your appeal at the hearing </li>
<li>Advise you on what to do after the tribunal have made a decision  
</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyone can be your representative, including friends and family.</p>  
    <p>Anyone who is registered as a representative will be sent all the information relating to your appeal, including medical evidence. They can also make decisions on your appeal but should only do this with your permission. </p>
