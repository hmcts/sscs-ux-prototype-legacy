           		<p>Manish is working as a travel agent when he suffers a mini stroke. 
He’s unable to return to work due to problems with focussing and his memory. 
He claims Disability Living Allowance from DWP for six months.</p>

<p>DWP then contact him to tell him that Disability Living Allowance is changing and he needs to be reassessed for its replacement, Personal Independence Payment (PIP). He goes to the assessment which is carried out by a healthcare professional.

<p> 
Four weeks later he receives a letter telling him he is being awarded PIP. 
But at a reduced rate, because he did not score enough points in the assessment.  
His benefit payments are reduced immediately.</p>
