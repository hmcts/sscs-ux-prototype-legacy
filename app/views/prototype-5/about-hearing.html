                What to expect at your hearing 
            </h1>
            <p class="lede">Your hearing is an opportunity for you to explain your case and get a decision on your benefit appeal. The judge is independent and will listen to both sides of the dispute before making a decision.  </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">When you arrive </h2>
            <p>You’ll be greeted by a tribunal clerk. They will take care of you at the hearing venue and answer any questions you may have. You’ll then sit in a waiting area until your hearing begins.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The hearing room </h2>
            <p>The tribunal clerk will take you into a room for your hearing. The judge will be sat behind a table and you’ll be invited to sit opposite him or her. If you have someone to support you or give evidence they will sit next to you. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The people at your hearing </h2>
            <p>The judge runs the hearing. It’s their job to review the evidence and make a decision on your claim. They will not be dressed in a robe and wig, it’s not as formal as a court. </p>

            <p>Depending on your type of appeal, there may be other people who are helping the judge making a decision. For example a doctor or disability expert are present in a lot of Personal Independence Payment appeals. </p>

            <p>Lastly a representative from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) may also be there. They are not the person who made the decision on your benefits but they are there to speak on behalf of the DWP. 
            </p> 

            <h2 class="heading-medium">During your hearing </h2>
            <p>  The judge and the people advising the judge will ask you some questions. They are trying to understand how your condition affects your life. So they may ask how you cope with certain tasks or what types of of things you need help with.</p>

            <p>They may also ask you questions that relate to the evidence you or the DWP have provided. It’s important that you send any evidence at least two weeks before so they have time to read it before your hearing.</p>

            <p>The judge or other panel members will not ask you trick questions. They are just trying to decide whether you are legally entitled to the benefit you are claiming.</p>


            <h2 class="heading-medium">Getting a decision</h2>
            <p>After the panel members have finished asking you questions, you’ll be asked to wait outside while they discuss your appeal. You’ll then be asked back into the room to receive your decision. </p>

            <p>The judge will either tell you your appeal has been ‘allowed’ (which means you’ve won) or whether the original decision has been upheld. The judge will explain what this means in relation to your benefits. 

            <p>Sometimes the tribunal needs more time to make a decision. In that case, your decision will be posted to you. </p>

             <h2 class="heading-medium">After your hearing </h2>
                <p>If you accept the decision of the tribunal then that is the end of your appeal. If you have any further questions about your benefits, you will need to contact the DWP. </p> 

            <p>If you don’t accept the decision and you feel that you have legal grounds for an appeal you can request one. First you have to ask the judge to explain the decision. This means requesting a Statement of Reasons. </p>
