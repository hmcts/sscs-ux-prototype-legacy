                Providing evidence to support your appeal
            </h1>
            <p class="lede">Evidence is anything that supports your appeal. It could be letters, documents or medical records which show you have a particular condition. What you say at the hearing is also classed as evidence. All this helps the tribunal understand the facts of your appeal.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Medical evidence </h2>

            <p>This is the most common and useful form of evidence. Medical evidence is anything which shows you have a particular condition at the time of making your appeal. For example a copy of your medical records or letter from a consultant.</p>

<p>As a patient, you have a right to a copy of your medical records. If you want to submit them as evidence you should request them from your doctor as early as possible and send them to the tribunal.</p>

<p>If you think it will support your appeal, you could ask a medically qualified person who knows about your condition to write you a letter. For example a consultant at the hospital or a mental health worker. A letter is different from your medical records because it describes your condition and how it affects your life. </p>

<p>Try to obtain medical evidence as early as possible and send it to us at least 2 weeks before your hearing. If you bring it on the day, your hearing may be delayed to a different day because the tribunal has not had time to read it. </p>

<p>Please note that your doctor or consultant may charge you for your medical records or writing a letter. We cannot reimburse you for this. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Oral evidence</h2>

            <p>What you or anyone else says on your behalf at the hearing is classed as oral evidence. If you have a carer or someone who supports you in the home, you might want to invite them to come to the hearing and tell the tribunal about your condition. </p>

<p>You should check the person is happy with talking at your hearing and that they are available on the day. </p>

 <h2 class="heading-medium">Additional evidence </h2>
<p>Other evidence can be used to support your appeal. For example, a gas bill might show you were living at a particular address, a phone bill might prove you phoned the DWP on a particular day, or your bank statement might show your financial situation.  </p>

<p>Again, it is important that all documents are sent to the tribunal as early as possible. If you bring them on the day, the hearing may be delayed because the judge has not had time to read them. </p>
