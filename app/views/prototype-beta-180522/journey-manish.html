           		<h3 class="heading-small">Scenario</h3>
           		<p>Manish receives a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN) from DWP. It tells him they are sticking by their original decision to award his benefits at a reduced rate. He feels he is entitled to more.<p>

              <p>The letter tells him he can appeal the decision through an independent tribunal. There's a web site address for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/social-security-child-support-tribunal/">Appeal a benefit decision service on Gov.uk</a>.</p>

           		<p>He visits the web site and sees that he can appeal the DWP decision online. He completes the appeal form and receives an <a href="notifications/email-appeal-received-mvp">email confirming he's appeal has been received</a>.</p>
