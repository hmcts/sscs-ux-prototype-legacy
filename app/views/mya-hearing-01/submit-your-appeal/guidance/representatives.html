<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Representatives</h1>

<p>If you think youâ€™ll be unable to manage your appeal on your own you may want the help of a representative. They can help you with some or all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>Advise you on the law in relation to your appeal </li> 
<li>Help you prepare evidence to support your appeal </li>  
<li>Help you prepare a written statement for the tribunal </li> 
<li>Talk to us about your appeal on your behalf </li>  
<li>Help you explain your appeal at the hearing </li> 
<li>Advise you on what to do after the tribunal has made their decision
</li>  
</ul>

<p>There are support organisations who can provide this support for free, such as the <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a>. You can assign anyone to be your representative, including friends and family. </p>

<p>Anyone who is registered as a representative will be sent confidential information about you, such as medical evidence. They can also make decisions on your appeal but should only do this with your permission. </p>
