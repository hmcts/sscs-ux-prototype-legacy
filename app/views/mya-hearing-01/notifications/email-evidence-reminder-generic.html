	<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
<p>This is just a reminder that all evidence to support your PIP benefit appeal  should be sent as early as possible.  This is so there’s time to review it before your hearing.</p>

<p>The most useful evidence shows how your condition affects your life. For example, a letter from your doctor or a statement written by someone who knows you. </p>

<p>Find out more about what evidence the tribunal finds useful: <a href="../enter-lastname-evidence">https://track-appeal.platform.hmcts.net/evidence/vUXyPb17L2</a></p>

<p>Send your evidence to the following address, clearly marked with your appeal reference number. Please note that this is not where your hearing will be. </p> 

<p>Birmingham ASC<br/>
HM Courts and Tribunals Service<br/>
Administrative Support Centre (ASC)<br/>
P O Box 14620<br/>
