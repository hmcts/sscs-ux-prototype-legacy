	<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
	<p>The hearing for your 
PIP benefit  appeal  took place on <span style="">9 February 2017</span>. The tribunal was unable to make a decision because they need more medical evidence. </p>

<p>The tribunal needs your permission before it can see your medical records. We’ve sent you a consent form in the post which you should receive in a few days. Details of what to do are on the form. </p>

<p>If you provide your consent, we’ll contact your doctor or healthcare professional to request a copy of your medical records. We’ll then set a new date for your appeal to be heard by a tribunal.</p> 

<p>We’ll contact you next when a new hearing date has been set. </p>
<p>You can track the progress of your appeal any time: <br/><a href="../status?casenumber=SC012%2F34%2F56789&status=appeal">https://www.sscs.reform.hmcts.net/progress/fzpqcy/track-your-appeal</a></p>
