<h1 class="heading-large">What happens after you’ve appealed</h1>

<h2 class="heading-medium">The department is notified of your appeal </h2>
<p>Your appeal is sent to the department which made the decision about your entitlement to benefits. This will either be DWP, HMRC or your local authority. </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">The department responds to your appeal </h2>
<p>The department which made the decision writes a response. This should explain how they’ve made their decision and include any evidence. You can respond to this if you want. </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">A hearing takes place </h2>
<p>An informal hearing takes place in front of an independent tribunal. They will make an impartial decision on your entitlement to benefits. <a href="hearing">Find out more about the hearing</a>.</p>




<h2 class="heading-medium">Sending evidence to support your appeal </h2>
<p>Evidence can help the tribunal understand your condition or circumstances. It could be a medical assessment or report which shows how your condition affects your life. Or a written statement which explains your side of the appeal. </p>

<p>It’s important you send in evidence as early as possible.This is so the tribunal has time to read it before your hearing. You’ll be sent more information on how to send in evidence after you’ve submitted your appeal. </p>



<h2 class="heading-medium">How long does an appeal take? </h2>
<p>It depends on a lot of factors, such how busy the hearing venue is and how many appeals are being made. You can avoid delays by: </p>

 <ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>sending any evidence well before the hearing (if you have any)</li>
<li>turning up to the hearing on time (if you choose to go)</li>
<li>getting a <a href="representative">representative</a> early (if you need one) </li>
</ul>
