      Sending evidence to support your appeal 
    </h1>
    <p>Evidence includes anything which shows how your condition affects your life, such as a letter from your doctor or healthcare professional. </p>
    <p>You or someone who knows you could also write a statement. It all helps the independent tribunal understand your appeal.  </p>  
    <p>Send in any evidence as soon as possible after you’ve submitted your appeal. This is so there’s time to read it before your hearing. </p>

    <div class="panel panel-border-wide">Only send evidence which you have not already sent to DWP.</div>

    <p>You’ll get a letter <span style="color: red;">and an email [if email given]</span> telling you the address to post your evidence a few days after submitting your appeal.
