		<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
		<p>The hearing for your 
		PIP benefit  appeal  was due to take place on [Hearing date]. It didn’t go ahead because the tribunal needs further evidence to help them make a decision. </p>
		<p>We’ll organise a new hearing when we have the further evidence. We’ll send you a request for evidence in the post if we need anything from you. </p>
		<p>You’ll hear from us when the tribunal has received the evidence and we’ve booked a new hearing for your appeal. </p>
		<p>You can track the progress of your appeal any time: <a href="../#">https://track-appeal.platform.hmcts.net/trackyourappeal/vUXyPb17L2</a></p>
