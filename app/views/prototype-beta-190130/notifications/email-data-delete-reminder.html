		<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
		<p>The [benefit name acronym] appeal application you saved on [save date] is going to be deleted on [delete date]. This is because we only save your data for [X] days.</p>

<p>If you still want to submit this appeal application then you need to sign in and complete it by [delete date minus one]. 
</p>
		<h2 class="heading-medium">Sign in and complete your appeal </h2>

	<p>If you do not want to appeal then you do not need to do anything. The information you entered will be deleted automatically. </p>
