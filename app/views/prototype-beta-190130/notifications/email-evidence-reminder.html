			<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
			<p>This is just a reminder that all evidence to support your PIP benefit appeal should be sent as early as possible. This is so there’s time to review it before your hearing.</p> 
			
			<p>The most useful evidence shows how your condition affects your life, for example a letter from your doctor or someone who lives with you or knows you well. </p>

			<p>Find out more about what evidence the tribunal finds useful: <a href="../enter-lastname-evidence">https://track-appeal.platform.hmcts.net/evidence/vUXyPb17L2</a></p>

			<p>You can either upload it or send it in the post. </p>

			<p>Upload your evidence here: <a href="../idam-set-up">https://track-appeal.platform.hmcts.net/evidence-upload/vUXyPb17L2</a></p> 

			<p>Post your evidence to the following address. Make sure it’s clearly marked with your appeal reference number: SC242/16/03435</p>

				Administrative Support Centre (ASC)<br/>
