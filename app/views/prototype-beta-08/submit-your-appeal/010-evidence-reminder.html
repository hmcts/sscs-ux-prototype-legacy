  <p>If you have any evidence, it should be sent to us as early as possible to avoid delaying your appeal.</p> 

<p>Evidence is anything which shows how your condition affects you at the time of the assessment by the DWP. Such as a letter, assessment or report from a doctor.</p>  

<p>You can send this to us separately after you’ve submitted your appeal.</p> 

<p>We’ll send you details on how to submit evidence after you’ve submitted your appeal.</p>
