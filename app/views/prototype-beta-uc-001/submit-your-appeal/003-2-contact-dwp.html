    <p>Before you can appeal you need to ask DWP to reconsider their decision about your entitlement to Universal Credit. This is called requesting â€˜mandatory reconsideration'. </p>

<p>You can do this in your <a  href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit" target="_blank">Universal Credit online journal</a> (opens in a new window).</p>
