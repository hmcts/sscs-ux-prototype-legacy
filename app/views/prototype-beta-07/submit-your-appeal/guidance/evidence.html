<h1 class="heading-large">Evidence to support your appeal</h1>

<p>Evidence is anything which helps the tribunal understand your side of the appeal. It could be a medical report, letter from your doctor or even a phone bill. What you say at the hearing is also classed as evidence.</p>


<p>It’s important that you send any evidence as early as possible. This is so there's time to read it before your hearing. We’ll send you information on how to do this when you’ve submitted your appeal.</p>  

<p>If you want to send in medical evidence, you’ll need to request this as early as possible from your doctor. Please be aware they may charge you for this. Unfortunately we can’t reimburse you.</p> 

<p>You don’t  have to send evidence  if you don’t have any.
