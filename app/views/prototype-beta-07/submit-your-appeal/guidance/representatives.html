<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Representatives</h1>

<p>If you think you’ll be unable to manage your appeal on your own you may want the help of a representative. They can help you with some or all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>Advise you on the law in relation to your appeal </li>
<li>Help you prepare evidence to support your appeal  </li>
<li>Help you prepare a written statement for the tribunal </li>
<li>Talk to the tribunal on your behalf </li>
<li>Help you present your appeal at the hearing </li>
<li>Advise you on what to do after the tribunal has made their decision</li> 
</ul>

<p>Anyone who is registered as a representative will be sent confidential information about you, such as medical evidence. They can also make decisions on your appeal. </p>

<p>You can assign anyone to be your representative, including friends and family. There are support organisations such as Citizens Advice Bureau, Disability Rights and Welfare Rights who have experience in supporting people throughout their appeals. </p>
