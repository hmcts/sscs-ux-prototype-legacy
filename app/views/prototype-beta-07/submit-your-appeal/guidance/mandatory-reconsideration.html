<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Mandatory reconsideration</h1>

<p>Before appealing you have to ask the government department who made the decision to reconsider it. This is known as requesting mandatory reconsideration. </p>

<p>To request mandatory reconsideration you’ll need to:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet"> 

  <li>Find out which department made the decision (using the list below)</li>
<li>Find the department’s contact details (from any letters you’ve received from them) </li>
<li>Phone or write to them telling them you want to challenge their decision. </li>
</ul>

<p>They should then send you a mandatory reconsideration notice. This tells you whether they have changed their decision. If you still don’t agree you can then appeal using this service.</p>

<p>You don’t have to get a mandatory reconsideration notice for Housing Benefit. You just need to phone up your local council and tell them you want to appeal. For Child Benefit you have to phone HMRC first.</p>
