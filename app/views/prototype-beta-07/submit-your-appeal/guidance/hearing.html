<h1 class="heading-large">What to expect at your hearing </h1>


            

            <img src="/public/images/p8/hearing-room.png">
            <p>A typical tribunal hearing with a judge and medical experts.</p>


<p>The hearing is where you explain your appeal. The tribunal is independent and will listen to both sides before making a decision.  </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">When you arrive </h2>

            <p>You’ll be greeted by a tribunal clerk. They’ll take care of you at the hearing venue and answer any questions you may have. You’ll sit in a waiting area until your hearing begins. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The hearing room </h2>
            <p>The tribunal clerk will take you into the room for your hearing. The judge and other panel members will be sat behind a table. You’ll be invited to sit opposite them. If you have someone to support you or to give evidence, they’ll sit next to you. </p>



            <h2 class="heading-medium">The people at your hearing </h2>
            <p>The tribunal is made up of a panel of people who’ll make a balanced decision on your appeal. They’re independent from the department who made the decision about your benefits.  </p>

<p>The judge runs the hearing. They’ll explain how it works. They’ll also take notes throughout. This is to create a record of the hearing. </p>

<p>Depending on the type of benefit you are appealing, there may be a doctor or another expert sat next to the judge.</p> 




            <h2 class="heading-medium">The department who made the decision </h2>
            <p>A representative from the department who made the decision about your entitlement to benefits may be there. For example, someone from the DWP. They are there to speak for  the department. They won’t be the person who made the decision about your benefits.  </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">During your hearing </h2>
            <p>The judge and the other panel members will ask you some straightforward questions. They’re trying to understand your appeal better. </p>

<p>Sometimes the panel members will need more evidence or information to help them make a decision. It’s important that you submit all your evidence well before the hearing so they have time to review it. Otherwise they may have to postpone the hearing to a different day. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Getting a decision</h2>
            <p>After you’ve answered all the questions you’ll be asked to wait outside while the panel members discuss your appeal. You’ll then be asked back into the room to be told the decision.</p>

<p>Sometimes they may need more time. If that happens  then the decision about your appeal will be posted to you.</p>
