<h1 class="heading-large">Start an appeal</h1>

<p>You can appeal if you disagree with a decision that was made about your entitlement to benefits. For example Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) or Housing Benefit (HB).</p>

<p><a href="overview">See all the benefit decisions you can appeal</a></p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Before you start</h2>
<p>For most benefits you have to ask DWP to reconsider their decision before you appeal. This is known as requesting mandatory reconsideration. DWP will then send you a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN) which tells you whether they have changed their decision. </p> 

<p>If you’re appealing a decision about Housing Benefit then you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">phone your local authority</a> before appealing. For Child Benefit you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/child-benefit">phone HMRC</a> first. </p>

<p>To use this service you’ll need: 
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet"> 
<li>your Mandatory Reconsideration Notice</li>
<li>your National Insurance number</li>
<li>details of anyone who’s supporting you with your appeal. Such as a <a href="representatives">representative</a> or friend or family member. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Help with appealing</h2>
<p>There are welfare rights organisations that can give you free support with your appeal. You can search online for organisations that operate in your local area and deal with the benefit you’re appealing. </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Appealing by post</h2>
<p>The only way to appeal most benefit decisions is by downloading, filling out and posting a paper form. You’ll be taken to the right form when you <a href="start-an-appeal">start your appeal</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re appealing a decision about  Employment and Support Allowance you can <a href="start-an-appeal">apply online</a> or  <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=3038">download a paper form</a>. It’s quicker and more convenient to apply online.</p>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Financial support </h2>
<p>The appeal can take several months. If you think you’ll struggle for money you should contact <a href="#">DWP</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus/existing-benefit-claims">Jobcentre</a>  or your <a href="">local council</a> to see whether they can help. </p>
