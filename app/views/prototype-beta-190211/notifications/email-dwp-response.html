		<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p>
		<p>DWP have responded to your PIP benefit appeal. They should have sent you a copy of their response in the post.</p>
		<p>Your appeal hearing needs to be booked. You don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive another update by [date + 8 weeks].</p>

		
				<h2 class="heading-medium">Sending evidence to support your appeal</h2>
		<p>The most useful evidence shows how your condition affects your life, for example a letter from your doctor or someone who lives with you or knows you well. You don’t have to send anything if you don’t have it.</p>

		<p>Find out more about what evidence the tribunal finds useful: <a href="../benefit-appeal-evidence">https://appeal-benefit-decision.service.gov.uk/evidence/vUXyPb17L2</a></p>
		
		<p>Post any evidence to the address below as soon as possible. This is so the tribunal have time to read it. </p>

		<div class="panel panel-border-wide">

			<p>Make sure you include a copy of the ‘evidence cover sheet’ which was included in the first letter you received about your benefit appeal. This is so we can link your evidence with your appeal. </p>
