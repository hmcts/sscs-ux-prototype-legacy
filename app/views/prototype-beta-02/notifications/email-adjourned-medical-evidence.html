	<p>Dear <span style="color: green;">Mr M Sharma</span><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal; font-size: 19px;"> [Title and name as in GAPS2]</span></p>
	<p>The hearing for your <span style="color: green;">ESA benefit </span><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">[Appeal benefit type]</span> appeal  took place on 9 February 2017 <span style="color: red;">[Date hearing due to place]</span>. The tribunal was unable to make a decision because they need more medical evidence. </p>

<p>The tribunal needs your permission before it can see your medical records. We’ve sent you a consent form in the post which you should receive in a few days. Details of what to do are on the form. </p>

<p>If you provide your consent, we’ll contact your doctor or healthcare professional to request a copy of your medical records. We’ll then set a new date for your appeal to be heard by a tribunal.</p> 

<p>We’ll contact you next when a new hearing date has been set. </p>
