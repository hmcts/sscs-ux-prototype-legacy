                Sending evidence to support your appeal 
            </h1>
<p>If you have any evidence, you should send it as early as possible to avoid delaying your appeal. </p>

<p>Evidence is anything which shows how your condition affects your life at the time of the assessment by DWP. For example, a doctor’s letter or a written statement by yourself or someone who knows you. </p>

<p>You can send this to us after you’ve submitted the appeal. We’ll send you details of how to do this by post [and email.] </p>
