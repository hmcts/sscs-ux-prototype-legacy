<h1 class="heading-large">Start an appeal</h1>

<p>You can appeal if you disagree with a decision that was made about your entitlement to benefits. For example Employment Support Allowance (ESA), Personal Independence Payment (PIP) or Housing Benefit (HB).</p>
<p><a href="overview">See all the benefit decisions you can appeal</a></p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Before you start</h2>
<p>For most benefits you have to ask DWP to reconsider their decision before you appeal. This is known as requesting mandatory reconsideration. DWP will then send you a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice (MRN) which tells you whether they have changed their decision. </p> 

<p>If you’re appealing a decision about Housing Benefit then you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">phone your local authority</a> before appealing. For Child Benefit you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/child-benefit">phone HMRC</a> first. </p>

<p>To use this service you’ll need: 
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet"> 
<li>your Mandatory Reconsideration Notice</li>
<li>your National Insurance number</li>
<li>details of anyone who’s supporting you with your appeal. Such as a <a href="representatives">representative</a> or friend or family member. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Appealing by post</h2>
<p>The only way to appeal most benefit decisions is by downloading, filling out and posting a paper form. You’ll be taken to the right form when you <a href="start-an-appeal">start your appeal</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re appealing a decision about  Personal Independence Payment you can <a href="start-an-appeal">apply online</a> or  <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=3038">download a paper form</a>. It’s quicker and more convenient to apply online.</p>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Financial support </h2>
<p>The appeal can take several months. If you think you’ll struggle for money you should contact <a href="#">DWP</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus/existing-benefit-claims">Jobcentre</a>  or your <a href="">local council</a> to see whether they can help. </p>
